The site is availabe to view live here: https://nektro.github.io/

My personal GitHub Pages page. My previous website (https://me.nektro.net/) and previously (https://www.nektro.net/) served me very well but as I have grown as a developer learning more things, my site has grown to reflect that. In this current iteration of my site, it reflects by push on using statically built sites as well as having them be open source. The vast majority of the projects listed on my GitHub are static SPAs that use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an occasional use of SASS to use nested selectors. Bloat is a massive problem on the Web right now, and I'm doing my part in helping with that by building the smallest, fastest, yet still effective apps and pages I can make.

This site is also able to share common themes with files such as [theme.css](theme.css). More of these to come. For example: [nektro.github.io](https://nektro.github.io/) and [/emojis/](https://nektro.github.io/emojis/)
